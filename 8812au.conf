# Log level options: ( rtw_drv_log_level )
#
# 0 = NONE (default)
# 1 = ALWAYS
# 2 = ERROR
# 3 = WARNING
# 4 = INFO
# 5 = DEBUG
# 6 = MAX

#  2 = Force auto enable (use caution)
#
# Notes:
# - Unless you know what you are doing, don't change the default.
# - A non-default setting can degrade performance greatly in managed mode.
# - For 5GHz AP mode, such as when you are using hostapd, setting this
#   option to 2 will allow 80 MHz channel width.

#
# 0 = No switch
# 1 = Switch from usb 2.0 to usb 3.0

#
# Notes:
# - When using the 2.4 GHz band in AP mode, use the default setting.
# - When using the 5 GHz band in AP mode, rtw_switch_usb_mode=1 works well.
